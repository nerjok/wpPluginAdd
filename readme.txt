<h2>wordpress plugins allowing to use job site feed</h2>

<p>Its a test version of how it can be implemented fully, basicaly 
script functionality can be extended and customized further</p>

<p>Right now if anyones is interested we just used some DOMDocument methods 
along with the curl to get remote content, The test comes with darbo.lt 
site add's parsing.</p>

<p>The plugin is organized as a wordpress widget, but very simply
it can be reverted to everythere available tool</p>
